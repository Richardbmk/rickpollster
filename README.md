# POLL APP

This is one of the first projects using Django 3.0. This project is from Django Documentation, and I also have to look some Youtube channels like Traversy Media and Dennis Ivy to make this simple App. You can check the page working well on this link: https://rickpollster.herokuapp.com/

##### Stack (Front-End & Back-End)
* BackEnd:
    * Django 3.0 (Python Framework)


* ForntEnd:
    * HTML and CSS
    * Bootstrap 4 (Another CSS Freamwork)

* Database:
    * PostgreSQL (with heroku addonss)

##### Deployment Method
For the deployment I use Heroku to host the webpage and PostgreSQL to store the database. I prefer MySQL as a DBMS but for some rason it was not working during deployment on Heroku.
